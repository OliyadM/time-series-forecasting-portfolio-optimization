Time Series Forecasting for Portfolio Management Optimization
Project Overview
This project focuses on using time series forecasting techniques to predict market trends and optimize investment portfolios. By leveraging historical financial data for three key assets (Tesla, Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF, and the S&P 500 ETF), the goal is to provide actionable insights for financial analysts to enhance portfolio performance while minimizing risk.

The project involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the financial data.

Time Series Forecasting: Building models such as ARIMA and LSTM to predict future stock prices and returns.

Portfolio Optimization: Using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to generate an optimal portfolio based on predicted returns and risk.

Backtesting: Simulating portfolio performance over historical data.

Business Objective
Guide Me in Finance (GMF) Investments is a financial advisory firm that uses data-driven insights to create tailored investment strategies. By applying time series forecasting techniques, GMF aims to predict market trends, optimize asset allocation, and enhance portfolio performance. The goal is to help clients achieve financial objectives by minimizing risks and capitalizing on market opportunities.

Data Sources
The project uses historical financial data for three key assets from Yahoo Finance:

Tesla (TSLA): A high-growth, high-risk stock in the automobile manufacturing sector.

Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND): A bond ETF providing stability and income.

S&P 500 ETF (SPY): An ETF tracking the S&P 500 Index for diversified, moderate-risk market exposure.

The dataset covers the period from July 1, 2015, to July 31, 2025. The data includes:

Open, High, Low, Close prices

Volume of shares traded

Adjusted Close price

Usage
1. Data Preprocessing
First, run the 01_data_preprocessing_and_exploration.ipynb notebook to load, clean, and preprocess the data. This includes:

Checking for missing values

Normalizing the data

Calculating daily returns, volatility, and other key metrics

Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations

2. Time Series Forecasting
You will implement two types of models for forecasting the stock prices of Tesla:

ARIMA Model
Run the 02_arima_forecasting.ipynb notebook to:

Fit an ARIMA model on the Tesla stock data

Forecast future stock prices using historical data

LSTM Model (Optional)
Run the 03_lstm_forecasting.ipynb notebook to:

Build an LSTM model to predict stock prices

Compare the performance with the ARIMA model

3. Portfolio Optimization
Run the 04_portfolio_optimization.ipynb notebook to:

Use the predicted returns from your models (ARIMA or LSTM) to calculate the optimal portfolio using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)

Plot the Efficient Frontier and identify the Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio and Minimum Volatility Portfolio

4. Backtesting (Final Submission)
Finally, in 05_backtesting.ipynb, simulate the portfolio performance using the historical data and compare it against a benchmark portfolio (e.g., 60% SPY / 40% BND). This will help you evaluate the viability of your strategy.

Evaluation Criteria
Data Preprocessing: Proper cleaning and handling of missing values.

Modeling: Accurate application of forecasting models (ARIMA and/or LSTM).

Portfolio Optimization: Efficient use of MPT to generate the Efficient Frontier and optimal portfolios.

Backtesting: Valid comparison of portfolio performance with a benchmark.

Documentation: Clear and well-commented code, along with appropriate visualizations and analysis.

Expected Outcomes
Time Series Forecasting: Accurate predictions of future stock prices or returns for Tesla.

Optimized Portfolio: An optimal portfolio balancing returns and risk using the predicted data.

Backtesting Results: Simulated performance of the proposed strategy compared to a benchmark.
